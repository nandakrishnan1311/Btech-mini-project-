# Twilio Free Message and Call API Guide

This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to get started with Twilio's free message and call API services using their trial account.

## 1. Create a Twilio Account
1. Visit [Twilio's official website](https://www.twilio.com/).
2. Sign up for a free account using your email address and verify your phone number.

## 2. Verify Your Account
- Verify your email and phone number.
- Twilio may request additional information to confirm legitimate use.

## 3. Access Free Trial Credits
- Twilio provides **free trial credits** (approximately $15.50) after successful verification.
- These credits can be used for sending messages or making calls.

## 4. Get a Twilio Phone Number
1. Go to the **Phone Numbers** section in the Twilio Console.
2. Purchase a phone number using your free trial credits (this will not cost money during the trial).
3. This number will be used to send SMS or make calls.

## 5. Understand Trial Account Limitations
- **Verified Numbers:** Messages and calls can only be sent to verified numbers.
- **Branding:** Messages include "Sent from your Twilio trial account."
- **Caller ID:** Custom sender IDs are not available.

## 6. Set Up Messaging/Call Services
Use the following Python code to send a message via Twilio:

```python
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio credentials
account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

message = client.messages.create(
    body="Hello from Twilio!",
    from_='+1234567890',  # Your Twilio number
    to='+0987654321'      # Verified recipient number
)

print(message.sid)
```

### Steps:
1. Replace `your_account_sid` and `your_auth_token` with your Twilio credentials. These are available in the **Twilio Console Dashboard**.
2. Replace the `from_` value with your Twilio phone number.
3. Replace the `to` value with a verified phone number.

## 7. Upgrade for Full Features
To:
- Send messages or make calls to unverified numbers.
- Remove Twilio branding.

Upgrade your account. Twilio offers **Pay-as-you-go pricing**, enabling flexibility in usage.

## 8. Explore Additional Offers
